# Console-based Games in C
This repository contains some mini games made using C language.
I created these games to practice C programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, random numbers, and logic building.

It includes 3 games:
-Prison Escape Game
-Rock Paper Scissors (Basic)
-Rock Paper Scissors[rps] (Advanced)



## 1. Rock Paper Scissors (Basic)

This is a simple version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game.

Features:
Rock, Paper, Scissors options
Computer chooses randomly
Win / Lose / Draw result
Runs continuously until exit

Concepts Used:
if-else
switch
while loop
rand() function
This game helped me understand basic game logic and user input handling.



## 2. Rock Paper Scissors (Advanced Version)

This is an improved version with more features and better gameplay.

Features:
Time Reaction Mode
Shows “Get Ready…”
Waits for input for 2–5 seconds
Shows “GO!”
If player takes more than 3 seconds to respond, an automatic move is selected
Starts with Rock, Paper, Scissors
After 5 wins, new moves are unlocked
10 Round Mode
Scoreboard is shown
Final winner is displayed

This version focuses more on game mechanics and state tracking.



## 3. Prison Escape Game

This is a story-based decision game.
You are in prison and you must escape by choosing different options.
Each choice changes what happens next.

Features:
Multiple decision paths
Different endings
Story-based gameplay

Concepts Used:
Nested if-else
Logical branching
User-driven flow

This game helped me understand how decision trees work in programming.
